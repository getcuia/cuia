> A delightful tiny framework for building reliable text-based applications.

**cuia** is a tiny Python library for building interactive terminal user
interfaces that is easy to use, fast and has a small memory footprint.

## Features

-   🧵 Simple: your user interface is a string of characters
-   💬 Interaction-focused
-   🖥️ Support for Unix variants out of the box:
    [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/curses.html) under the hood by
    default (and probably works on Windows and DOS if a compatible curses
    library is available)
-   🤬 Only one dependency: [cusser](https://github.com/getcuia/cusser)
-   🐍 Python 3.8+

## Installation

```console
$ pip install cuia
```
