    Make a request to the server and report the status code.

    This coroutine is a command that can be executed by cuia. A command is any coroutine
    that performs some action and returns an optional message about its result.
    Returning `None` is also OK and means that the command has silently finished
    (useful when notifying back is not necessary).

    We return a message representing the error instead of raising it, because this way
    we ensure that the error is reported to the user through our UI.

    **Note**: what if you need to pass some data to a command? Use a factory function:

    >>> def command_with_arg(id: int) -> Command:
    ...     async def command() -> Optional[cuia.Message]:
    ...         return SomeMessage(id)
    ...     return command

    Then you can call this factory function when you need to get a command.
